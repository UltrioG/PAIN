BaseFrame is a subclass of the Container class. It serves as the foundation for other frame types and provides additional functionality specific to the BaseFrame. The main difference between BaseFrame and other frame types is that BaseFrame does not have a parent.

If you want to create a BaseFrame, you will have to use [basalt.createFrame](objects/basalt/createFrame.md)

In addition to the Object, VisualObject and Container methods, baseframe also has the following methods:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[getOffset](objects/BaseFrame/getOffset.md)|Returns the current offset of the BaseFrame object
|[setOffset](objects/BaseFrame/setOffset.md)|Sets a new offset for the BaseFrame object
