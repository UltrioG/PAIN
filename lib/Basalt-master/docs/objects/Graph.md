Graph is a versatile object for visualizing data in various formats such as scatter, line, or bar graphs. It inherits from the ChangeableObject, VisualObject, and Object classes, which provide it with additional properties and methods. The Graph object allows you to customize its appearance, manage data points, and define the display range.

In addition to the methods inherited from the Object, VisualObject, and ChangeableObject classes, Graph objects have the following methods:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[setGraphColor](objects/Graph/setGraphColor.md)|Sets the color of the graph
|[setGraphSymbol](objects/Graph/setGraphSymbol.md)|Sets the symbol used to represent data points in the graph
|[getGraphSymbol](objects/Graph/getGraphSymbol.md)|Returns the symbol used to represent data points in the graph
|[addDataPoint](objects/Graph/addDataPoint.md)|Adds a data point to the graph
|[setMaxValue](objects/Graph/setMaxValue.md)|Sets the maximum value displayed on the graph
|[getMaxValue](objects/Graph/getMaxValue.md)|Returns the maximum value displayed on the graph
|[setMinValue](objects/Graph/setMinValue.md)|Sets the minimum value displayed on the graph
|[getMinValue](objects/Graph/getMinValue.md)|Returns the minimum value displayed on the graph
|[setGraphType](objects/Graph/setGraphType.md)|Sets the type of the graph (scatter, line, or bar)
|[setMaxEntries](objects/Graph/setMaxEntries.md)|Sets the maximum number of data points displayed on the graph
|[getMaxEntries](objects/Graph/getMaxEntries.md)|Returns the maximum number of data points displayed on the graph
