MovableFrame is a subclass of the Frame class, inheriting from Container, VisualObject, and Object classes. MovableFrame objects extend the functionality of Frame objects by allowing users to move them with the mouse, providing an interactive element to your interface.

In addition to the methods inherited from Frame, Container, VisualObject and Object, MovableFrame has the following methods:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[setDraggingMap](objects/MovableFrame/setDraggingMap.md)|Creates a small XY map for the areas where the MovableFrame can be dragged with the mouse
|[getDraggingMap](objects/MovableFrame/getDraggingMap.md)|Returns the current dragging map of the MovableFrame

These methods allow you to define the specific areas within the MovableFrame where it can be dragged and moved, providing flexibility and control over user interactions with your interface.
