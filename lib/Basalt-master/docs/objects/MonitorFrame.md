MonitorFrame is a subclass of the BaseFrame class. It is specifically designed for use with in-game monitors, allowing you to display content on monitors and manage multiple monitor groups. MonitorFrame inherits all methods from BaseFrame and provides additional functionality for working with in-game monitors.

To create a MonitorFrame, you can use the basalt.addMonitor() function.

In addition to the Object, VisualObject, Container, and BaseFrame methods, MonitorFrame also has the following methods:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[setMonitor](objects/MonitorFrame/setMonitor.md)|Sets the in-game monitor to display the MonitorFrame content
|[setMonitorGroup](objects/MonitorFrame/setMonitorGroup.md)|Sets the monitor group for managing multiple monitors
