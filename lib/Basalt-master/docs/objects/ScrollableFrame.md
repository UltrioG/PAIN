ScrollableFrame is a subclass of the Frame class, inheriting from Container, VisualObject, and Object classes. ScrollableFrame objects extend the functionality of Frame objects by allowing users to scroll through the content either vertically or horizontally, providing an interactive element to your interface when dealing with larger amounts of content.

In addition to the methods inherited from Frame, Container, VisualObject and Object, ScrollableFrame has the following methods:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[setDirection](objects/ScrollableFrame/setDirection.md)|Sets the scrolling direction of the ScrollableFrame, either 'vertical' or 'horizontal'

This method allows you to define the specific scrolling direction for the ScrollableFrame, providing flexibility and control over user interactions with your interface when dealing with larger amounts of content that may not fit within the visible area of the frame.
